Kai currently holds a Junior Visiting Position in Numerical Analysis at CRM Ennio De Giorgi at Scuola Normale Superiore in Pisa. He obtained his Ph.D. in applied math under the supervision of Martin Stoll at TU Chemnitz with the thesis titled 'Matrix functions in muliplex network analysis'. His research interests include
- Numerical linear algebra (Krylov subspace methods for matrix functions and linear systems, preconditioning, nonlinear spectral methods)
- Exponential integrators for stiff systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs)
- Network science (Centralities, community detection, core-periphery detection, dynamical processes in the form of ODEs on networks, multiplex and multilayer networks)

Kai is a member of the [The f(A)bulous Scientific Network for Matrix Functions and Exponential Integrators](https://sites.google.com/view/fabulous-dfg-scinet/) funded by DFG.
