This is the personal website of Kai Bergermann. He obtained his Ph.D. in applied math under the supervision of Martin Stoll at TU Chemnitz with the thesis titled 'Matrix functions in muliplex network analysis'. His research interests include
- Numerical linear algebra (Krylov subspace methods for matrix functions and linear systems, preconditioning, nonlinear spectral methods)
- Exponential integrators for stiff systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs)
- Network science (Centralities, community detection, core-periphery detection, dynamical processes in the form of ODEs on networks)
